## Background

It is recognized that online learning is becoming increasingly important. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning is indispensable in billions of students’ learning journeys. We see that many online learning platforms have emerged, and there are various ways to record how students interact with these platforms in the form of log data. These log data, which cannot be collected in offline classes, should be helpful for instructors and students to understand the learning progress better. However, due to the complexity of the log data, it is challenging to make them interpretable and meaningful for students and instructors. 

## Project Objective
Our project intends to build a web tool to make log data informative for students and instructors. Using our web tool, **students** can visualize their learning progress and receive guidance for the course review to boost their final grades. **Instructors** can better understand their students’ academic performance and easily construct student groups for the group project, which would possibly have a relatively similar academic potential between groups.

## Data sources

**Name**: Educational Process Mining (EPM): A Learning Analytics Data Set
**Source**: ([click here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Educational+Process+Mining+(EPM)%3A+A+Learning+Analytics+Data+Set))
**Overview**: A group of 115 students of first-year, undergraduate Engineering major at the University of Genoa studied over a simulation environment named Deeds (Digital Electronics Education and Design Suite), and their log activities on the online learning platform, intermediate session grades, and final exam grades are recorded.
